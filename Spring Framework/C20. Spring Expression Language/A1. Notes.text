Spring Expression Language (SpEL) is a powerful expression language that provides a way to dynamically evaluate expressions at runtime. It is a part of the Spring Framework and is used extensively in Spring applications.

SpEL provides a rich set of features for building expressions, including arithmetic operations, logical operators, comparison operators, regular expressions, and more. It also provides a way to reference beans and properties in the Spring container, making it easy to integrate with Spring applications.

SpEL can be used in various contexts, including configuration files, annotations, and code. It can be used to configure properties of beans, to evaluate conditions in a conditional bean definition, and to perform data binding.

Some examples of SpEL expressions are:

#{3 + 4} - Evaluates to 7
#{'Hello ' + 'World!'} - Evaluates to "Hello World!"
#{T(java.lang.Math).PI * 5} - Evaluates to approximately 15.7
#{person.name} - Evaluates to the value of the "name" property of the "person" bean in the Spring container.
Overall, SpEL provides a powerful and flexible way to build and evaluate expressions in Spring applications.

Supports Parsing and executing expression with the help of @Value annotations

Expression     @Value("#{expression}")
expression can be Classes, Variables, Methods, Constructors, Objects and symbols.
symbols can be char, numerica, operators, keywords and special symbols which return a value. 

@Value("#{11+22}") = 33
@Vlue("#{8>6?88:66}")
you can also call object methods, static methods, variable
