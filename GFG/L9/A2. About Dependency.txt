Spring-boot-starter
    -Spring Boot
      -Spring Core
         - spring-jcl
Spring boot starter depends on spring boot, spring boot depends on spring core so on.

<Parent> tag in pom.xml has our parent which means keeping it as parent we have our own project. Every spring boot project will have spring-boot-starter-parent as a parent. It can have other name of the projects as well
Ex. amazon has project amazon.spring.project and its parent is spring.main.project. Now they want to create a new project prime.video. Now it'll just mention amazon.spring.project as parent.

and <properties> has version of java.
<build> tag: it contains plugin, if you dont have any plugin it'll normally act like a maven project.

      <plugin>
				<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
				<artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
			</plugin>
this plugin is telling maven that build this project as a spring-boot project.
