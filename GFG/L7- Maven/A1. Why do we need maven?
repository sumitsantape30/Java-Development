/////////////////////////// Host and Port ///////////////////////////////////

Host- Is is an IP address.

Host: A host is like a home address for a computer or a device on a network. It's a unique identifier that tells other devices 
where to find and communicate with it. Just like you have a home address to receive mail, a computer or server has a host address 
to receive data and requests from other computers over a network.

Port: Think of a port as a specific entrance or door at a host's address. It's a way to differentiate between different services 
or applications running on the same computer. Imagine a big building (the host), and each office or room (the port) has a different 
purpose or service. Ports help direct incoming data to the right place within a host.

When you combine a host and a port, you can specify exactly where you want to send data on a network. This is essential for computers 
and devices to communicate effectively, as it helps them know both where to send data and which service or application to use on the 
target machine.

When you combine a host and a port, you create a specific address on the receiver's side. This address tells other devices on the 
network where to send data and which service or application to use on the receiver's machine.

Think of it like a street address (the host) and a room number (the port) in a building. The street address gets the mail to the 
right building (receiver's device), and the room number tells you exactly which room (service or application) within that building to 
deliver the mail to. Together, they form the complete address on the receiver's side, ensuring that data reaches the intended destination
within the device.
