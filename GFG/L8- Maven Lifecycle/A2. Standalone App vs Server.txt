Apart from great UX + Deployment + data analysis eveything is handled by backend developer.
A good backend developer is who has strong knowledge of Springboot + databases + Caching + pub sub + version control. 

pub sub is machanism where you interact with outside world using some messages.
pub sub: publisher subscriber.
eg: when a new video is uploaded from a channel you have subscribed you get a notification this is pubsub. Creator is publisher and you are subscriber.

Standalone Application:

A standalone application is a software program that is designed to run on a single device or computer. It typically doesn't require continuous internet connectivity or external resources while it's running.
Standalone applications are often used for tasks that can be completed in a single session and don't need to run indefinitely. For example, word processors, video games, and image editors are often standalone applications.
Server Application:

A server application, often referred to as a server, is software that runs continuously on a server computer and responds to client requests over a network, typically the internet. Servers are designed to provide services or data to other devices or clients.
Server applications are expected to run for extended periods, often indefinitely, and they are responsible for handling incoming requests and providing responses as needed. Examples include web servers, email servers, and database servers.
Servers may or may not require internet connectivity, depending on their specific functionality. Some servers operate on closed networks, while others are accessible over the internet.
