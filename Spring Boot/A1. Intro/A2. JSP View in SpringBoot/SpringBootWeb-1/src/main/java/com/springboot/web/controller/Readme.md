what is the use of controller in spring boot, what content is in @Controller annotation class

In Spring Boot, a controller is a crucial component that is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and providing an appropriate response. Controllers are a part of the Spring Web module and are often annotated with the @Controller annotation to indicate that they are meant to handle HTTP requests.

Here's what the @Controller annotation class typically contains:

1. HTTP Request Handling Methods: Inside a class annotated with @Controller, you define methods that handle specific HTTP requests. These methods are annotated with various HTTP method annotations like @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping, etc. These annotations define which HTTP methods the method should respond to and the request mapping (URI) that triggers the method.

@Controller
public class MyController {
    
    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
    
    @PostMapping("/create")
    public ResponseEntity<String> create(@RequestBody MyObject object) {
        // Handle POST request and return a response
    }
}

2. Request Mapping: The @Controller class often has a @RequestMapping annotation at the class level, specifying a common base URI for all the methods within the controller. This allows you to group related endpoints under a common base URL.


@Controller
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class MyController {
    // ...
}
3. Method Logic: The methods within the controller contain the logic to process incoming requests, perform any necessary business logic, and return an appropriate response. The return type can vary, such as a String for rendering a view, a ResponseEntity for customizing HTTP response details, or a data object serialized as JSON.

4. Dependency Injection: Controllers can also make use of dependency injection to access services, repositories, or other components required to fulfill the request. You can inject dependencies using annotations like @Autowired.

@Controller
public class MyController {
    
    private final MyService myService;
    
    @Autowired
    public MyController(MyService myService) {
        this.myService = myService;
    }
    
    // ...
}
In summary, a Spring Boot @Controller class is used to define methods that handle incoming HTTP requests. These methods are annotated with request mappings and can contain the logic needed to process the requests, including calling services or repositories, and returning responses to the client. The @Controller annotation is a fundamental building block for creating web applications with Spring Boot.
